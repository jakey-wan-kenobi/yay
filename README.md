# Yay! Prizes

#### An Open Source Slack Bot Built with Node

## Hello There ðŸ‘‹

[Yay!](https://yay.hintsy.io/) is a unicorn that lets you send cool prizes to your friends, without ever leaving Slack. On the surface itâ€™s a toy, but underneath itâ€™s a team and culture building tool (and a toy). It was built by the team behind [Hintsy](https://hintsygifts.com). Weâ€™re open sourcing the codebase, even though itâ€™s not a module or library or anything else that can be used in your projects as a dependency. We did this in hopes that it's useful for developers building on the Slack API (or creating Node backends in general).

If you're curious, we wrote more about it on [Medium](LINK).

## Working with the Slack API

We wrote a

# About the App
##### A few areas that might be of general interest to developers. I review them all in detail in the Github repo, but Iâ€™ll list them out below.

### Async/Await & Promises
We used this ES7 feature extensively throughout the app, and it was glorious. It opens up some pretty amazing capabilities, with a few caveats. One thing I didnâ€™t particularly like was that you end up using async functions as wrappers for your async functionality. I ended up using self executing anonymous functions as wrappers. Itâ€™d be nice to have some alternative way to declare that youâ€™re about to run some async functions. Check out the repo for more details.

### Directory Structure & Naming Conventions
We experimented with a very literal structure and naming conventions. Component files have names like `getOrderDetailsFromStripeID.js`. It might seem a bit overkill, but it was actually incredibly helpful as we built out and reused components across the app. I think Iâ€™m going to stick with naming conventions like these moving forward. Itâ€™s helpful that anyone with a rough understanding of the codebase can look at a component name and easily get what itâ€™s used for.

### Server Setup

Babel installation (reference page), Node, Nodemon, pm2,

We built it in Node, with Babel and Express (and like 25 other dependencies, of course).

Nodemon is great for development, but is definitely not stable enough for production use. Instead, we use pm2 for production, which is also more cumbersome to use for development. I think using both for the two use cases gives you the best of both worlds.

### Deployment & Build Scripts
I donâ€™t like to plunge tons of time into CI or automated deployment until I really need them. What weâ€™ve done instead is implement some basic bash scripts into our npm build scripts, so that doing something like `npm run up` sends our built files to our server over ssh. If I were to improve from there, I'd also restart the server remotely. We're using pm2, and as it is now I ssh into the server and `pm2 restart server` to restart with the new build.

### Firebase Database
Firebase is awesome for getting things scaffolded quickly. I highly recommend it for casual hacking, and I even in several production apps (like this one), though I likely would have used something like Postgres if I intended for this to be a larger effort.

### Authentication
We use the Slack OAuth flow, combined with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), as our authentication system. No passwords. I wrote more about the flow in this Github repo. To summarize: user clicks the Sign In button => user is sent to Slack => user authorizes the app => user is sent back to Yay along with a payload that identifies them => we verify that payload, create a JWT, and send it back to the browser for them. Now theyâ€™re logged in.

### Documentation & Commenting
I began using the JSDoc commenting style to mark up my components, even though I donâ€™t plan to use the auto-documentation capabilities. I just wanted a consistent way to implement comments and inline documentation. I found this extremely helpful. I think it could even serve as an intermediary step to getting static typic setup in your codebase (because JSDoc asks you to define the types of all your function parameters, which invites you to think about it).

### Analytics & Error Handling
Nothing special, but if anyoneâ€™s curious about deploying a monitoring/logging solution like Rollbar or Sentry, take a look. We also use Heap for analytics. Implementation is pretty simple, but command-F "Heap" if you're curious.

### Environment Variables
It sounds obvious, but itâ€™s not. Iâ€™ve seen real life codebases that support tons of users, with all kinds of API secrets and tokens sprinkled throughout the code. Use environment variables. Do it.

### Email & SMS
We use Mailgun and Twilio (and I can't recommend either service highly enough).

### Weak Areas
Just like any real life codebase, a few parts of it suck. One of those is unit tests. Didnâ€™t write a single one. We could also dry up some error pages. Also, I use `require` instead of `import` in a few places where I totally spaced and couldnâ€™t get it to work with `import`.

Also, response times from the Slack and Stripe APIs aren't always the best. Sometimes I can only turn a response around in about 400-500ms. If I were really worried about it, I'd implement redis for caching the products we're fetching (there's no need to fetch them from the Stripe API every time).

Finally, we could probably make the development and production environments more distinct, using enviornment variables to serve up different functionality.

##### Things to Be Done

- Unit tests
- e2e tests
- Better deployment automation
- Dev and production environments, better distinction
- Caching (responses could be faster)

#### `npm run up` will upload files from local yay directory to /home/yay

This allows you to...

1. Run `nodemon server.js` on the server
2. Make your changes locally and save them
3. Go into local terminal and run `npm run up`
4. Watch the server restart on the remote (live) server

So now there's no need to sync local and remote scripts by copy/pasting. Next step would be to auto-upload the changes on save (either a watch script, or with something like save-commands for atom editor), so we run the `npm run up` command on save.


**Process for Deploying to Remote Server**
1. Clone bare repo on the server itself (so it's just .git file sitting in there)
2. Then create a script that literally just checks out the repo into the folder you want it to be in


**We're going to need our own authentication system.** We can use Slack/OAuth to allow Yay to access Slack information. But how do we identify our users when the requests aren't coming directly from Slack, with the relevant tokens included? For example, how do we log them in at yay.hintsy.io and allow them to change their credit card or address?

I think the best process is:
1. User clicks 'Sign in with Slack'
2. Slack authorizes the user, returning a code, which we exchange for an accses_token
3. We save this access_token and relevant user/team info to Firebase.
4. We use the access_token(?) to create a signed JWT, and send that to browser in a cookie. Redirect user to account page.
5. Then we use the JWT to lookup the corresponding team (decoding it to query by access_token). We should then indexOn access_token for performance.

Note that since this is the case, we might as well use Mongo rather than Firebase.

### How to generate a random key to use for JWT secret:

`node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(256).toString('base64'));"`

This generate a random base64 string that's super long.
