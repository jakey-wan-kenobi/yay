# Yay! Prizes

#### An Open Source Slack Bot Built with Node

<a href="http://standardjs.com/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg" alt="Standard"></a>


## Hello There üëã

[Yay!](https://yay.hintsy.io/) is a unicorn that lets you send cool prizes to your friends, without ever leaving Slack. On the surface it‚Äôs a toy, but underneath it‚Äôs a team and culture building tool (and a toy). It was built by the team behind [Hintsy](https://hintsygifts.com). We‚Äôre open sourcing the codebase, even though it‚Äôs not a module or library or anything else that can be used in your projects as a dependency. We did this in hopes that it's useful for developers building on the Slack API (or creating Node backends in general).

If you're curious, we wrote more about it on [Medium](LINK).

Below you'll find a few notes and pointers for building on the Slack API, along with a brief overview of all the things in this repo that may be interesting to developers looking for inspiration.

# Working with the Slack API
The Slack platform team is incredibly helpful and kind, and the development experience is a pleasure. Their API docs are world class. There‚Äôs a nice, helpful Slack development community that happily answered a variety of questions for us. And there are tools like the Slack message builder that help you compose complex messages and visualize changes. There are just a few gotchas I would call out to people trying to create a Slack bot for the first time.

## Working with Permissions and¬†Scopes
First, working with permissions and scopes is a little painful. Slack has implemented some extremely granular permissions and scopes so that apps request only the absolute minimum amount of access to data that they need to function. This is good. But it‚Äôs also a pain to work with and understand.

Remember this: if you‚Äôre installing a bot, a ton of permissions come along with that bot. You don‚Äôt need to add specific scopes and permissions that are already covered by the [‚Äúbot‚Äù permission](https://api.slack.com/bot-users) (a lot of them overlap). You can see all default bot permissions here. But pay attention: if you‚Äôre using a permission that comes along with your ‚Äúbot‚Äù permissions, you need to use the bot‚Äôs access token. If you‚Äôre using a permission that you‚Äôve specifically requested, you need to use the general access token. This was the source of confusion a few different times, and I think it could be made clearer in the docs.¬†

One other thing regarding permissions and scopes: the Slack API management console asks you to fill in all the permissions and scopes you‚Äôre requesting, with explanations for why you need them. This section is only used in the review process. It does not grant your app those permissions automatically. To do that, you must include the permissions you want on the initial auth flow URL, like this:
¬†
```
https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?scope=commands,bot,chat:write:user&client_id=XXXXXX
```

This app, for example, has requested the `commands`, `bot`, and `chat:write:user` permissions.¬†
Also remember: if you change the scopes in this URL, you need to remove and reinstall the app in Slack for your changes to propagate. They won‚Äôt update automatically (seems obvious, but hey‚Ä¶).¬†

## Building ‚ÄúApp‚Äù Functionality with Message¬†Buttons
Message buttons are one of the more sophisticated features of the Slack API, allowing users to perform more complex actions and layer in functionality and communication with external services.¬†

![Slack message buttons](https://a.slack-edge.com/dcb1/img/api/message_guidelines/Example_6.gif)

They‚Äôre a bit of a pain to work with. You can only set up a single route in your API to receive all message button requests. That means if your app has 7 different buttons for various functionality (like ours), you‚Äôll need to stuff various parameters into the message object when you‚Äôre building it that identifies what kind of action it should take when it‚Äôs clicked. It also means you‚Äôre listening for all 7 of those message button events on the same route (`api/yayMessageButtons`), with some kind of if/then or switch logic to handle them all. Plus, there‚Äôs only 2 places to put your parameters (the actions.name and callback_id), meaning you have to get creative if you need more than that. In our case, we did need more than that, so we had to concatenate certain values and stuff them all in the callback_id, then parse them when they came back in an event. See the `slackApp/buildPrizeMessage` component for more details.

This aspect of the API should probably change. It‚Äôs too cumbersome. It‚Äôd be relatively easy to define the URL you‚Äôd like the message button to hit on the actual message object itself, which would allow you to separate all of this out into different functionality. It‚Äôd also be nice to have a metadata array on the object, where you can put optional, custom fields. But what are you gonna do?

# About This App
##### A few areas that might be of general interest to developers. I review them all in detail in the Github repo, but I‚Äôll list them out below.

### Async/Await & Promises
We used async/await, an ES7 feature, extensively throughout the app. It was glorious. It opens up some pretty awesome capabilities. We used it in combination with `axios`, a promise-based HTTP library. This allows you to do things like build a component that returns a POST request made with axios (thereby returning a promise), then `await`ing that component in an async function. (Every promise can be `await`ed inside an async function).

If you have multiple requests to make, you can string them together very easily this way.

As an example, check out `site/auth`, where we await a variety of requests (like `account/exchangeSlackCodeForToken`, for example).

```
function exchangeSlackCodeForToken (codeRecieved) {
  let promise = axios.post('https://slack.com/api/oauth.access', qs.stringify({
    client_id: process.env.SLACK_CLIENT_ID,
    client_secret: process.env.SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET,
    code: codeRecieved
  })).catch(function (error) {
    captureException(error, 'Error accessing a URL with axios', 196830)
  })
  return promise
}
```

Then later on, in `site/auth`, I can use this component like this:

```
(async function () {
  // Exchange the code for a token
  const result = await exchangeSlackCodeForToken(req.query.code)
  // Save the new token to Firebase, or sign the user in if already exists
  const nextResult = await saveNewSlackAccountOrSignIn(result.data, db, res)

  [Do more logic]...

)()

```

This flow is really interesting. It allows you to build out components, then string them together consecutively. It's very easy to understand, and is ridiculously easy compared with callbacks and working directly with promises. Your async function becomes a kind of "runway" for your business logic, which is all neatly contained elsewhere. You just have to make sure your components are returning promises rather than the direct values themselves.

And remember, you don't have to use a library like `axios` either. You can just create a promise in your components and return it. Check out `account/getSlackTokenFromTeamID`, for example, where it starts with `return new Promise(function (resolve, reject)...)`.

Also, make absolute sure you aren't `awaiting` when you don't actually have to. Sometimes you need to `await` 2 or more values, but they don't need to await each other to execute. You want all of your processes to run as soon as they can. To get around instances like this, you can call all your ready-to-execute, promise-returning functions simultaneously, and then await them later on. For example, check out `api/creditCardDetails`, on line 33, where I want to make 2 requests and then check which one exists to move forward. What I *don't* want to do is make one request, wait till it finishes to see if it exists, and then make my second requst if it doesn't. This would double our time spent waiting for requests in cases where the first value doesn't exist.

```
(async function () {
  const response = {}
  // NOTE: These can run parallel, but we need both before moving forward. So we invoke the functions immediately to run concurrently, and simply await the promises of both before proceeding.
  const teamStripeIDPromise = getTeamStripeIDFromTeamSlackID(decodedJWT.team_id, db)
  const stripeIDPromise = getStripeIDFromSlackID(decodedJWT.team_id, decodedJWT.user_id, db)
  const teamStripeID = await teamStripeIDPromise
  const stripeID = await stripeIDPromise

  [Do more logic]...

)()

```


### Directory Structure & Naming Conventions
We experimented with a very literal structure and naming conventions. Component files have names like `getOrderDetailsFromStripeID.js`. It might seem a bit overkill, but it was actually incredibly helpful as we built out and reused components across the app. I think I‚Äôm going to stick with naming conventions like these moving forward. It‚Äôs helpful that anyone with a rough understanding of the codebase can look at a component name and easily get what it‚Äôs used for.

### Server Setup

We built this app in Node, with Babel and Express (and like 25 other dependencies, of course). We followed this general pattern for scaffolding the app: https://github.com/babel/example-node-server.

We use both Nodemon and pm2. Nodemon is great for development, but is definitely not stable enough for production use. Instead, we use pm2 for production, which is also more cumbersome to use for development. I think using both for the two use cases gives you the best of both worlds.

### Deployment & Build Scripts
I don‚Äôt like to plunge tons of time into CI or automated deployment until I really need them. What we‚Äôve done instead is implement some basic bash scripts into our npm build scripts, so that doing something like `npm run up` sends our built files to our server over ssh. If I were to improve from there, I'd also restart the server remotely. We're using pm2, and as it is now I ssh into the server and `pm2 restart server` to restart with the new build.

Check the `package.json`, specicially the `up` process. Running `npm run up` will send all the files in our repo up to our server.

### Firebase Database
Firebase is awesome for getting things scaffolded quickly. I highly recommend it for casual hacking, and I even in several production apps (like this one), though I likely would have used something like Postgres if I intended for this to be a larger effort.

In this case, our `account/database` component creates our database instance, and we pass it around to the entire app by importing the module.

### Authentication
We use the Slack OAuth flow, combined with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), as our authentication system. No passwords. I wrote more about the flow [here](https://github.com/jakey-wan-kenobi). To summarize: user clicks the Sign In button => user is sent to Slack => user authorizes the app => user is sent back to Yay along with a payload that identifies them => we verify that payload, create a JWT, and send it back to the browser for them. Now they‚Äôre logged in.

Check out the `auth` directory, along with the `site/auth` component to learn how this works.

### Documentation & Commenting
I began using the JSDoc commenting style to mark up my components, even though I don‚Äôt plan to use the auto-documentation capabilities. I just wanted a consistent way to implement comments and inline documentation. I found this extremely helpful. I think it could even serve as an intermediary step to getting static typic setup in your codebase (because JSDoc asks you to define the types of all your function parameters, which invites you to think about it).

Take a look at nearly any component, at the top of the page, to see what I'm referring to.

### Analytics & Error Handling
Nothing special, but if anyone‚Äôs curious about deploying a monitoring/logging solution like Rollbar or Sentry, take a look. We also use Heap for analytics. Implementation is pretty simple, but command-F "Heap" if you're curious.

See `core/captureException` for exception handling. The Heap tracking details are sprinkled throughout.

### Environment Variables
It sounds obvious, but it‚Äôs not. I‚Äôve seen real life codebases that support tons of users, with all kinds of API secrets and tokens sprinkled throughout the code. Use environment variables. Do it.

We used [dotenv for Node](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv), which allows you to insert `process.env.VALUE`, where `VALUE=hereismyvalue` is contained as a line in your `.env` file (which you of course don't commit to your repo).

### Email & SMS
We use Mailgun and Twilio (and both services are excellent). We also use the [dot templating engine](http://olado.github.io/doT/index.html), which is really fast and straightforward. Twilio is for sending alerts to admins when prizes are purchased.

See `email/sendPurchaseEmails` and `twilio/sendTexts` for details.

### Areas for Improvement
Just like any real life codebase, a few parts of it suck. One of those is unit tests. We didn‚Äôt write a single one. We could also dry up some error pages. Also, I use `require` instead of `import` in a few places where I totally spaced and couldn‚Äôt get it to work with `import`.

Also, response times from the Slack and Stripe APIs aren't always the best. Sometimes I can only turn a response around in about 400-500ms. If I were really worried about it, I'd implement Redis for caching the products we're fetching (there's no need to fetch them from the Stripe API every time).

Finally, we could probably make the development and production environments more distinct, using environment variables to serve up different functionality.
